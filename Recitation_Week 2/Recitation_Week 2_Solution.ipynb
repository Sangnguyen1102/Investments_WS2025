    "* The non-callable bond (Bond X) has higher convexity.\n",
    "* When rates fall by 1%, the callable bond (Bond Y) will see its price rise less, because the issuer can call it away, capping the investor’s upside. That call option reduces convexity and limits price gains when yields drop.\n",

    "**Bond A (2% coupon)** has the higher Macaulay Duration.\n",

    "**Reason:** Duration is the weighted-average time to receive the bond's cash flows. Bond B (8% coupon) pays large cash flows early and often, shifting its duration forward in time. Bond A (2% coupon) pays very small coupons, meaning the vast majority of its value is in the final payment at maturity.

    "* When interest rates fall, the bond’s price does not keep rising faster; instead, the price increase slows down and can flatten out.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For a callable bond, as rates drop, the chance of being called goes up. The issuer can buy it back at the call price, so:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The investor’s upside is capped when rates fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - But when rates rise, the bond can’t be called, so the investor still suffers full downside.\n",
